Problem definition: 
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the popularity values of songs based on various features such as song duration and danceability.


List of ML Methods to implement:
Linear Regression
KNN
Using these methods will let us look at the problem from different angles and compare their performance

Brief description of the data
The data contains Top Hits from Spotify ranging from 2000 to 2019.
Features include:
artist, song, duration, danceability, popularity

Description of Data settings or preprocessing (if need)
Most of the data have direct, graphable values like song duration. However, other features like artist or genre will require some preprocessing to include in our model.

Experiment Design
First we need to organize our data, doing preprocessing and creating a clean data set that can be used in our model.
We then need to split our data into specific training and testing sections.
We then split into two models, the first using KNN and the second using linear regression.
With both models we can then take the results and plot them in a loss graph, which then can be used to compare the two models.
